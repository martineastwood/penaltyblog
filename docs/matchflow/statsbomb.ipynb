    "# Using Flow with StatsBomb Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow includes a built-in integration with the StatsBomb API, making it easy to stream structured football data directly into your pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than loading everything upfront, Flow wraps the API as **lazy operations** - each call builds a plan that fetches the data only when needed (e.g., on `.collect()` or `.to_pandas()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure your **StatsBomb credentials** are set as environment variables if you're using private access:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export SB_USERNAME=\"your_username\"\n",
    "export SB_PASSWORD=\"your_password\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from penaltyblog.matchflow import Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch all competitions\n",
    "comps = Flow.statsbomb.competitions()\n",
    "\n",
    "for comp in comps.head(3):\n",
    "    print(comp)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All API calls return a `Flow`, so you can apply all usual transformations like `.filter()`, `.select()`, `.assign()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç Available Endpoints\n",

    "| Method                                            | Description                        |\n",
    "| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n",
    "| `.competitions()`                                 | All competitions available via API |\n",
    "| `.matches(competition_id, season_id)`             | Matches for a specific season      |\n",
    "| `.events(match_id)`                               | All events in a match              |\n",
    "| `.lineups(match_id)`                              | Lineups and formation for a match  |\n",
    "| `.player_match_stats(match_id)`                   | Player-level stats for a match     |\n",

    "| `.team_season_stats(competition_id, season_id)`   | Team stats over a season           |\n",

    "shots = (\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üßº Filtering & Transforming\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Flow supports deep access to nested fields, you can work directly with StatsBomb‚Äôs JSON structure without needing to flatten first:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from penaltyblog.matchflow import Flow, where_equals\n",
    "\n",
    "top_scorers = (\n",
    "    Flow.statsbomb.player_season_stats(competition_id=43, season_id=106)\n",
    "    .filter(lambda r: r[\"goals\"] >= 5)\n",
    "    .select(\"player.name\", \"team.name\", \"goals\")\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üê¢ Lazy Until Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, nothing is downloaded or processed until you **materialize the flow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.collect()` ‚Üí fetches all records\n",
    "- `.to_pandas()` ‚Üí fetches and converts to DataFrame\n",
    "- `.head(n)` ‚Üí fetches just the first n records\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = Flow.statsbomb.competitions().to_pandas()\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîí Authenticated Access\n",
    "\n",
    "All API methods accept a creds dictionary, or you can use environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Flow.statsbomb.events(match_id=123, creds={\"user\": \"...\", \"passwd\": \"...\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Useful for clubs or analysts already using StatsBomb data\n",
    "- Flows can be joined with your internal data or flattened and saved\n",
    "- Try `.flatten().to_jsonl()` to export clean JSONL for later\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìù Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow‚Äôs StatsBomb integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Keeps your data structured\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Streams on demand (not loaded eagerly)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Integrates with full Flow pipeline tools\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Works with both open and authenticated endpoints"
