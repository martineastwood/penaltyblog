**MatchFlow** is a lightweight toolkit for working with structured football data, especially nested JSON like StatsBomb event files or match-level logs. Whether you're building quick explorations or full pipelines, MatchFlow helps you work directly with deeply structured data using a clean, lazy, and chainable API.

What is MatchFlow?
------------------

Flow is not a DataFrame, it's a **stream-first query engine** built for irregular, event-based football data.

You can:

- Load JSON, JSONL, or entire folders of match data
- Filter and transform records lazily with ``.filter()``, ``.assign()``, ``.select()``
- Group and summarize using ``.group_by()`` + ``.summary()``
- Join datasets, explode lists, split arrays, pivot rows
- Work with nested data without flattening too early
- Chain steps fluently, materialize only when ready
- Filtering using string expressions, like ``"age > 30 and team == @team_name"``

All transformations are **lazy**; nothing runs until you ask for results with ``.collect()``, ``.to_pandas()``, ``.to_jsonl()`` etc.

Interactive Examples
--------------------

For a comprehensive, hands-on demonstration of the Matchflow, try the interactive Colab notebook.
The notebook walks you downloading data directly from the Statsbomb API (including Statsbomb's free, open data sets),
building data pipelines, and creating interactive vizualisations using ``penaltyblog``'s ``Pitch`` plotting library.
You can modify the code, experiment with different parameters, and see how the data changes in real-time.

Quick Start
------------

.. code-block:: python

   from penaltyblog.matchflow import Flow, where_equals

   # Load and filter StatsBomb shots
   flow = (
      Flow.statsbomb.events(match_id=19716)
      .filter(where_equals("type.name", "Shot"))
      .select("player.name", "location", "shot.statsbomb_xg")
   )

   for shot in flow.head(5):
      print(shot)

Ready to Flow?
--------------

Pick a section from the guide above, or jump in with ``.from_jsonl()``, ``.from_folder()``, or ``.statsbomb.events()``  and start building your pipeline.
