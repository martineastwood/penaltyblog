    "\n",
    "**penaltyblog** is a production-ready Python package designed for football (soccer) analytics, providing powerful tools from [pena.lt/y/blog](https://pena.lt/y/blog) for data analysis, outcome modelling, and betting insights. Optimized with Cython, **penaltyblog** delivers high-performance modelling to power faster, efficient predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- üîÑ **Streamline JSON Workflows with MatchFlow** ‚Äì Process deeply nested football event data using a lazy, streaming pipeline built for JSON. Filter, select, flatten, join, group, and summarize large datasets - all without loading everything into memory.\n",
    "- ‚öΩ **Scrape Data** ‚Äì Collect match statistics from sources like FBRef, Understat, Club Elo, and Fantasy Premier League.\n",
    "- üìä **Model Matches Efficiently** ‚Äì High-performance implementations of Poisson, Bivariate Poisson, Dixon-Coles, and other advanced statistical models, optimized with Cython for rapid analysis.\n",
    "- üí∞ **Bet Smarter** ‚Äì Precisely estimate probabilities for Asian handicaps, over/under totals, match outcomes, and more.\n",
    "- üèÜ **Rank Teams** ‚Äì Evaluate team strengths with sophisticated methods including Elo, Massey, Colley, and Pi ratings.\n",
    "- üìà **Decode Bookmaker Odds** ‚Äì Accurately extract implied probabilities by removing bookmaker margins (overrounds).\n",
    "- üéØ **Fantasy Football Optimisation** ‚Äì Mathematically optimize your fantasy football squad to maximize performance.\n",
