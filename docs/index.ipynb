    "\n",
    "- 🔄 **Streamline JSON Workflows with MatchFlow** – Process deeply nested football event data using a lazy, streaming pipeline built for JSON. Filter, select, flatten, join, group, and summarize large datasets - all without loading everything into memory.\n",
    "- ⚽ **Scrape Data** – Collect match statistics from sources like FBRef, Understat, Club Elo, and Fantasy Premier League.\n",
    "- 📊 **Model Matches Efficiently** – High-performance implementations of Poisson, Bivariate Poisson, Dixon-Coles, and other advanced statistical models, optimized with Cython for rapid analysis.\n",
    "- 💰 **Bet Smarter** – Precisely estimate probabilities for Asian handicaps, over/under totals, match outcomes, and more.\n",
    "- 🏆 **Rank Teams** – Evaluate team strengths with sophisticated methods including Elo, Massey, Colley, and Pi ratings.\n",
    "- 📈 **Decode Bookmaker Odds** – Accurately extract implied probabilities by removing bookmaker margins (overrounds).\n",
    "- 🎯 **Fantasy Football Optimisation** – Mathematically optimize your fantasy football squad to maximize performance.\n",
