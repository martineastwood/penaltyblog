The visualization module offers a high-level interface for plotting football (soccer) data.

At its core is the ``Pitch`` class, which provides flexible tools for rendering scatter plots,
heatmaps, arrows, and moreâ€”mapped directly onto the field of play.
Whether you're exploring tracking data, event locations, or tactical movements, ``Pitch``
helps you visualize it clearly and beautifully.

Interactive Examples
--------------------

For a comprehensive, hands-on demonstration of the plotting using ``Pitch``, try the interactive Colab notebook.
The notebook walks you through all the different plotting methods, themes and customization options.
