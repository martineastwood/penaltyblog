    "# Bet Sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "This submodule provides powerful tools for calculating optimal bet sizes using the **Kelly Criterion**, a mathematical formula designed to maximize the long-term growth of a bankroll.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single Bet Analysis (`kelly_criterion`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this function to perform a deep analysis of a single betting opportunity. It calculates the optimal stake and provides a wealth of metrics to help you understand the bet's risk and reward profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    decimal_odds: Union[float, NDArray, List[float]],\n",
    "    true_prob: Union[float, NDArray, List[float]],\n",
    "    fraction: float = 1.0,\n",
    ") -> KellyResult\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `decimal_odds`: The decimal odds for the bet (e.g., 2.5). Can be a single number or a NumPy array for multiple independent bets.\n",
    "- `true_prob`: Your estimated \"true\" probability of the outcome (from 0 to 1).\n",
    "- `fraction` (default=`1.0`): A fraction of the full Kelly stake to use. Common values are `0.5` for \"Half Kelly\" or `0.25` for \"Quarter Kelly\" to adopt a more conservative strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns (`KellyResult` Object)\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns a `KellyResult` data object containing a complete analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `stake` (`float`): The recommended fraction of your bankroll to wager (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).\n",
    "- `expected_growth` (`float`): The expected logarithmic growth rate of your bankroll if you place this bet. This is the metric that the Kelly Criterion optimizes.\n",
    "- `edge` (`float`): Your mathematical edge on the bet. A positive edge means the bet has a positive expected value.\n",
    "- `is_favorable` (`bool`): `True` if the bet has a positive edge.\n",
    "- `risk_metrics` (`RiskMetrics`): A detailed object containing advanced risk and return metrics. See the **Understanding the Risk Metrics** section below for a full explanation.\n",
