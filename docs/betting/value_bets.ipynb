    "# Identifying Value Bets\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"value bet\" is the cornerstone of any successful betting strategy. It's a bet where you believe the true probability of an outcome is higher than the probability implied by the bookmaker's odds. Placing value bets consistently is the key to long-term profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `identify_value_bet` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core function for value analysis. It takes bookmaker odds and your own estimated probabilities, and returns a comprehensive analysis of the betting opportunity, including expected value and a recommended Kelly stake.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "penaltyblog.betting.identify_value_bet(\n",
    "    bookmaker_odds: Union[float, List[float], NDArray],\n",
    "    estimated_probability: Union[float, List[float], NDArray],\n",
    "    kelly_fraction: float = 1.0,\n",
    "    min_edge_threshold: float = 0.0,\n",
    ") -> Union[ValueBetResult, MultipleValueBetResult]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `bookmaker_odds`: A single decimal odd, or a list/array of odds.\n",
    "- `estimated_probability`: Your estimated true probability (from 0 to 1) for the corresponding outcome(s).\n",
    "- `kelly_fraction` (default=`1.0`): The fraction of the Kelly Criterion to recommend (e.g., 0.5 for a more conservative \"Half Kelly\" stake).\n",
    "- `min_edge_threshold` (default=`0.0`): The minimum required \"edge\" (your probability minus the implied probability) for a bet to be flagged as a value bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "The function intelligently returns one of two detailed data objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ValueBetResult`: If you provide a single odd and probability.\n",
    "- `MultipleValueBetResult`: If you provide a list of odds and probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Single Bets (`ValueBetResult`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing a single bet, you get a detailed breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `is_value_bet` (`bool`): True if the bet has a positive edge above your threshold.\n",
    "- `expected_value` (`float`): The amount you expect to win or lose per unit staked. A positive EV indicates a profitable bet in the long run.\n",
    "- `edge` (`float`): The difference between your probability and the bookmaker's implied probability.\n",
    "- `recommended_stake_kelly` (`float`): The optimal fraction of your bankroll to stake, according to the full Kelly Criterion.\n",
    "- `recommended_stake_fraction` (`float`): The Kelly stake, adjusted by the kelly_fraction you provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Multiple Bets (`MultipleValueBetResult`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing a list of bets (e.g., a weekend's fixtures), you get a portfolio-level summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `individual_results` (`List[ValueBetResult]`): A list containing a detailed `ValueBetResult` object for each bet you provided.\n",
    "- `total_value_bets` (`int`): The number of bets in the list that were identified as having value.\n",
    "- `average_edge` (`float`): The average edge across all identified value bets.\n",
    "- `kelly_stakes` (`List[float]`): A list of the recommended (fractional) Kelly stakes for the entire portfolio of bets.\n",
