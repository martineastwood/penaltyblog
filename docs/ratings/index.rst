Ratings / Rankings
===================

Rating models such as Colley, Elo, Massey, and Pi Ratings are valuable tools for evaluating football teams because they provide objective, quantitative measures of team strength based on historical performance.

Unlike subjective evaluations, these models systematically incorporate match outcomes, scoring margins, and relative opponent strength, offering insights into team capabilities beyond simple league standings.

By quantifying team performance accurately, these rating systems can significantly enhance predictive modeling, inform strategic betting decisions, and identify undervalued or overvalued teams within betting markets or competition analyses.
