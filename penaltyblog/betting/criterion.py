    Calculate optimal bet sizes for multiple simultaneous outcomes using Kelly Criterion.

    This function handles portfolio optimization across multiple bets, ensuring that

    Parameters
    ----------
    decimal_odds : List[float]
        List of odds in European decimal format for each outcome
    true_probs : List[float]
        List of true probabilities for each outcome (should sum to â‰¤ 1.0)
